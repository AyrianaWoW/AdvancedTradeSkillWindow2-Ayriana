  ATSW has a search function built-in. If you type some text into the search box then ATSW will filter the recipe list according to your entry or the following parameters: :reagent, :level, :quality, :possible, :possibletotal. You can even combine multiple parameters and a text for a name search, like this:
"leather :level 20+ :quality uncommon+" - recipes with the word "leather" in their name, a minimum level requirement of 20 and a minimum quality of "green".
  
  
  ## Necessary reagents list

  The "Reagents" button will show you a list of reagents required to craft items in the task list, how many of the reagents you have in your inventory, in your bank, on alternative characters on the same server and if a reagent can be bought from a merchant. By hovering a cursor over the reagent count on alternative characters, you get a list of all alts currently possessing the item in question.

  ATSW can also automatically buy necessary items from a merchant when speaking to him - either manually by clicking a button in the reagents window or automatically when opening the merchant window.
  
  
  ## Linking

  By clicking on an item with chat line opened and Shift key pressed ATSW will add a list of the reagents necessary to create a single item into the chat window.
